# PRD Automation Template

This repository is a minimal template for automating Product Requirements Document (PRD) processing. It includes:

- A sample `prd.md` to demonstrate chunking.
- Documentation (`AUTOMATION_README.md`, `QUICK_START.md`) that explains how to configure and run the automation.
- A reusable automation module under `tools/automation/`.

## Getting Started

1. Replace `prd.md` with your own PRD (or update it in place).
2. Adjust `tools/automation/prd_auto_config.json` to point to your PRD path and desired chunk size.
3. Run the automation commands described in `QUICK_START.md`.

Use this template as a starting point or copy the `tools/automation/` directory into an existing repository.
